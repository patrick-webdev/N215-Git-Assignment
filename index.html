    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    <h3>Creating The Repository</h3>

    <p>
      The project leader is in charge of creating the repository. This can be
      done in many ways, but the easiest is with the
      <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop app</a>. Once
      downloaded, simply sign in and select File > "New repository..." at the
      top of the window. From there, just enter a name for the repo, add a
      description if desired, select a location to save your local copy of the
      repo on your computer to, and change the other optional settings if the
      default settings aren't right for your project. To finalize these choices
      and create your repo, press the blue "Create repository" button.

  <!-- inviting people -->

        src="img/inviting_people.png"
        alt="Inviting People"
      />
    </a>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <h3>Inviting People</h3>

    <p>
      The project leader now can invite others to be collaborators on the repo.
      This allows others to create branches, fetch and push files to those
      branches, and have access to other functionality. The project lead must
      open the repo they created in their web browser, which can be found at
      <a href="#" onclick="return false;">https://github.com/[user-name]/[repo-name]</a>. Once there,
      click on the settings tab near the top-right of the page, then click on
      the collaborators tab, enter your Github password if necessary, then enter
      the username, full name, of email of the person to be added as a
      collabotator. An email will be sent to that person on the account they
      used to create their Github account with an invite link they must click
      on to be added as a collaborator. Once the invite is accepted, they will
      be able to work on the repository.

  <!-- creating initial files -->

  <section class="step" id="step-three">
    <a href="img/creating_initial_files.PNG" target="new">
      <img
        class="step-img"
        src="img/creating_initial_files.PNG"
        alt="Creating Intiial Files Image"
      />
    </a>

    <h2>Step 3</h2>

    <h3>Creating Initial Files</h3>

    <p>
      The project leader creates files for their group. These files can be,
      but are not limited to, the index.html file, the css file, the scss
      file, and/or the JavaScript file. After these files are created the rest
      of the group can clone/download the files to their computer. This will
      allow them edit the repository without making changes to the actual
      repository itself. If they others to view their changes will have to
      push their changes. Fetching and pushing files allows the group to
      recieve any changes to the repository while making changes at the same
      time.
    </p>
  </section>
  <!-- fetching files -->

  <section class="step" id="step-four">
    <a href="img/github_fetch_files.png" target="new">
      <img
        class="step-img"
        src="img/github_fetch_files.png"
        alt="Fetch Files Image"
      />
    </a>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>

    <h3>Fetching Files</h3>

    <p>
      When working with a group, the first thing you want to do is fetch
      files. Doing this allows you to fetch any changes made by your group
      memebers. You can then review these changes and either make some
      adjustments to them or keep them the way that they are. In order to
      fetch files you will need to open your GitHub desktop first. At the top
      there will be a button with "Fetch Origin" on it. After a few seconds
      you will see a new prompt that reads "Pull Origin". Clicking on this
      allows yous to pull any changes and apply them to your version of the
      repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fetch Origin > Pull Origin > Few Changes with Coding Software (Visual
      Studio Code, Atom, Notepad, etc.) > Adjust Changes or Apply Them
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- pushing files -->
  <section class="step" id="step-five">
    <a href="img/github_push_files.png" target="new">
      <img
        class="step-img"
        src="img/github_push_files.png"
        alt="Push Files Image"
      />
    </a>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <h3>Pushing Files</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to fetching files, pushing file is the same process. Instead of
      downloading changes your group made, you are sending them changes that
      you made. When you make changes to the repository you will have to
      commit these changes. Commiting changes requires you to fill out the
      description box in the lower left corner of GitHub desktop. Once you are
      finished typing a description of your changes you can click on the
      commit to master button. After you commited your changes to the master
      branch you will then see a blue button pop up that says push origin.
      Clicking this sends your changes to the repository and allows your group
      members to few you changes and make any adjustments if needed.
