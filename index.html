      <h3>Creating Initial Files</h3>
      <p>
        The project leader creates files for their group. These files can be,
        but are not limited to, the index.html file, the css file, the scss
        file, and/or the JavaScript file. After these files are created the rest
        of the group can clone/download the files to their computer. This will
        allow them editthe repository without making changes to the actual
        repository itself. If they wanted to publish their changes to the acutal
        repository they would have to push their changes. Fetching and pushing
        files allows the group to recieve any changes to the repository while
        making changes at the same time.

    <!-- fetching files -->
    <section class="s4" id="step-four">
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <h3>Fetching Files</h3>
      <p>
        When working with a group, the first thing you want to do is fetch
        files. Doing this allows you to fetch any changes made by your group
        memebers. You can then review these changes and either make some
        adjustments to them or keep them the way that they are. In order to
        fetch files you will need to open your GitHub desktop first. At the top
        there will be a button with "Fetch Origin" on it. A few second or
        minutes after clicking this button you see a new prompt that reads "Pull
        Origin". Clicking on this allows yous to pull any changes and apply them
        to your version of the repository.
      </p>
    </section>
    <!-- pushing files -->
    <section class="s5" id="step-five">
      <h2>Step 5</h2>
      <h3>Pushing Files</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to fetching files, pushing file is the same process. Instead of
        downloading changes your group made, you are sending them changes that
        you made. When you make changes to the repository you will have to
        commit these changes. Commiting changes requires you to fill out the
        description box in the lower left corner of GitHub desktop. One you are
        finished typing a description of your changes you can then click on the
        commit to master button.
